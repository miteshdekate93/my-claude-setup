# Agent Orchestration

## Available Agents

Located in `~/.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Purpose | When to Use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| planner | Implementation planning | Complex features, refactoring |
| architect | System design | Architectural decisions |
| tdd-guide | Test-driven development | New features, bug fixes |
| code-reviewer | Code review | After writing code |
| security-reviewer | Security analysis | Before commits |
| build-error-resolver | Fix build errors | When build fails |
| e2e-runner | E2E testing | Critical user flows |
| refactor-cleaner | Dead code cleanup | Code maintenance |
| doc-updater | Documentation | Updating docs |
| rust-reviewer | Rust code review | Rust projects |

## Immediate Agent Usage

No user prompt needed:
1. Complex feature requests - Use **planner** agent
2. Code just written/modified - Use **code-reviewer** agent
3. Bug fix or new feature - Use **tdd-guide** agent
4. Architectural decision - Use **architect** agent

## Parallel Task Execution

ALWAYS use parallel Task execution for independent operations:

```markdown
# GOOD: Parallel execution
Launch 3 agents in parallel:
1. Agent 1: Security analysis of auth module
2. Agent 2: Performance review of cache system
3. Agent 3: Type checking of utilities

# BAD: Sequential when unnecessary
First agent 1, then agent 2, then agent 3
```

## Multi-Perspective Analysis

For complex problems, use split role sub-agents:
- Factual reviewer
- Senior engineer
- Security expert
- Consistency reviewer
- Redundancy checker

# Coding Style

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate existing ones:

```
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) → changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) → returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe concurrency.

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:
- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large modules
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:
- Handle errors explicitly at every level
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI-facing code
- Log detailed error context on the server side
- Never silently swallow errors

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate at system boundaries:
- Validate all user input before processing
- Use schema-based validation where available
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Never trust external data (API responses, user input, file content)

## Code Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:
- [ ] Code is readable and well-named
- [ ] Functions are small (<50 lines)
- [ ] Files are focused (<800 lines)
- [ ] No deep nesting (>4 levels)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use constants or config)
- [ ] No mutation (immutable patterns used)

# Development Workflow

> This file extends [common/git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) with the full feature development process that happens before git operations.

The Feature Implementation Workflow describes the development pipeline: research, planning, TDD, code review, and then committing to git.

## Feature Implementation Workflow

0. **Research & Reuse** _(mandatory before any new implementation)_
   - **GitHub code search first:** Run `gh search repos` and `gh search code` to find existing implementations, templates, and patterns before writing anything new.
   - **Library docs second:** Use Context7 or primary vendor docs to confirm API behavior, package usage, and version-specific details before implementing.
   - **Exa only when the first two are insufficient:** Use Exa for broader web research or discovery after GitHub search and primary docs.
   - **Check package registries:** Search npm, PyPI, crates.io, and other registries before writing utility code. Prefer battle-tested libraries over hand-rolled solutions.
   - **Search for adaptable implementations:** Look for open-source projects that solve 80%+ of the problem and can be forked, ported, or wrapped.
   - Prefer adopting or porting a proven approach over writing net-new code when it meets the requirement.

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Generate planning docs before coding: PRD, architecture, system_design, tech_doc, task_list
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format
   - See [git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) for commit message format and PR process

# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

Note: Attribution disabled globally via ~/.claude/settings.json.

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

# Hooks System

## Hook Types

- **PreToolUse**: Before tool execution (validation, parameter modification)
- **PostToolUse**: After tool execution (auto-format, checks)
- **Stop**: When session ends (final verification)

## Auto-Accept Permissions

Use with caution:
- Enable for trusted, well-defined plans
- Disable for exploratory work
- Never use dangerously-skip-permissions flag
- Configure `allowedTools` in `~/.claude.json` instead

## TodoWrite Best Practices

Use TodoWrite tool to:
- Track progress on multi-step tasks
- Verify understanding of instructions
- Enable real-time steering
- Show granular implementation steps

Todo list reveals:
- Out of order steps
- Missing items
- Extra unnecessary items
- Wrong granularity
- Misinterpreted requirements

# Common Patterns

## Skeleton Projects

When implementing new functionality:
1. Search for battle-tested skeleton projects
2. Use parallel agents to evaluate options:
   - Security assessment
   - Extensibility analysis
   - Relevance scoring
   - Implementation planning
3. Clone best match as foundation
4. Iterate within proven structure

## Design Patterns

### Repository Pattern

Encapsulate data access behind a consistent interface:
- Define standard operations: findAll, findById, create, update, delete
- Concrete implementations handle storage details (database, API, file, etc.)
- Business logic depends on the abstract interface, not the storage mechanism
- Enables easy swapping of data sources and simplifies testing with mocks

### API Response Format

Use a consistent envelope for all API responses:
- Include a success/status indicator
- Include the data payload (nullable on error)
- Include an error message field (nullable on success)
- Include metadata for paginated responses (total, page, limit)

# Performance Optimization

## Model Selection Strategy

**Haiku 4.5** (90% of Sonnet capability, 3x cost savings):
- Lightweight agents with frequent invocation
- Pair programming and code generation
- Worker agents in multi-agent systems

**Sonnet 4.6** (Best coding model):
- Main development work
- Orchestrating multi-agent workflows
- Complex coding tasks

**Opus 4.5** (Deepest reasoning):
- Complex architectural decisions
- Maximum reasoning requirements
- Research and analysis tasks

## Context Window Management

Avoid last 20% of context window for:
- Large-scale refactoring
- Feature implementation spanning multiple files
- Debugging complex interactions

Lower context sensitivity tasks:
- Single-file edits
- Independent utility creation
- Documentation updates
- Simple bug fixes

## Extended Thinking + Plan Mode

Extended thinking is enabled by default, reserving up to 31,999 tokens for internal reasoning.

Control extended thinking via:
- **Toggle**: Option+T (macOS) / Alt+T (Windows/Linux)
- **Config**: Set `alwaysThinkingEnabled` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- **Budget cap**: `export MAX_THINKING_TOKENS=10000`
- **Verbose mode**: Ctrl+O to see thinking output

For complex tasks requiring deep reasoning:
1. Ensure extended thinking is enabled (on by default)
2. Enable **Plan Mode** for structured approach
3. Use multiple critique rounds for thorough analysis
4. Use split role sub-agents for diverse perspectives

## Build Troubleshooting

If build fails:
1. Use **build-error-resolver** agent
2. Analyze error messages
3. Fix incrementally
4. Verify after each fix
'@ | Set-Content -Encoding UTF8 "$rulesDir\performance.md"

# Security Guidelines

## Mandatory Security Checks

Before ANY commit:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (sanitized HTML)
- [ ] CSRF protection enabled
- [ ] Authentication/authorization verified
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive data

## Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Use **security-reviewer** agent
3. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
4. Rotate any exposed secrets
5. Review entire codebase for similar issues
'@ | Set-Content -Encoding UTF8 "$rulesDir\security.md"

@'
# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows (framework chosen per language)

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:
1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
6. Verify coverage (80%+)

## Troubleshooting Test Failures

1. Use **tdd-guide** agent
2. Check test isolation
3. Verify mocks are correct
4. Fix implementation, not tests (unless tests are wrong)

## Agent Support

- **tdd-guide** - Use PROACTIVELY for new features, enforces write-tests-first
'@ | Set-Content -Encoding UTF8 "$rulesDir\testing.md"

# ── CLAUDE.md in current directory ───────────────────────────────────────────
@'
# Workflow Orchestration

## 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately – don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

## 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

## 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

## 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

## 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes – don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

## 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests – then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

# Code Style: Readable & Explainable

**Principle:** Simple code > Clever code. You must be able to explain it in 2 minutes.

## Functions: Short & Clear
- **Max 20 lines per function** — else break it into smaller ones
- **One responsibility** — if it does A and B, split it
- **Clear names** — not `u`, `d`, `x` — use `user`, `document`, `count`

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Clear intent, easy to test, explainable
function canUserDeleteDocument(user: User, document: Document): boolean {
  const isDocumentOwner = user.id === document.ownerId;
  const isAdmin = user.role === 'admin';
  return isDocumentOwner || isAdmin;
}

// ❌ AVOID: Nested logic, hard to explain
function canDel(u: User, d: Document) {
  return u.id === d.ownerId ? true : u.role === 'admin' ? true : false;
}
```

## Variable Names: Explicit, Readable
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Anyone reading this aloud understands it
const userHasAccessToSharedDocument = user.sharedDocuments.includes(docId);
const documentOwnerEmail = document.owner.email;
const maxLoginAttemptsBeforeLockout = 5;

// ❌ AVOID: Abbreviations, single letters
const hasAccess = u.docs.includes(d);
const ownerMail = doc.o.e;
const max = 5;
```

## Comments: Explain WHY, Not WHAT
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Why is this needed? Business rule? Technical constraint?
const MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 5;  // Security: Prevent brute-force attacks

// ✅ GOOD: Complex logic gets a one-liner before the code
// Only process documents modified in last 24h to avoid re-indexing entire dataset
const recentDocuments = documents.filter(d => {
  const oneDayAgo = Date.now() - (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  return d.modifiedAt > oneDayAgo;
});

// ❌ AVOID: Comments that just repeat code
const user = getUserById(id);  // Get user by ID
```

## Error Messages: Helpful
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: User knows what went wrong + how to fix it
if (!req.body.userEmail) {
  return res.status(400).json({
    error: 'Missing userEmail in request body',
    example: { userEmail: 'john@example.com' }
  });
}

// ❌ AVOID: Cryptic errors
if (!req.body.email) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid input' });
}
```

# ECC Commands

When implementing features, use these ECC agents to keep code readable:

## `/plan` — Structure Before Code
**When:** Starting a feature or fixing a bug
**What it does:** Breaks down task into clear steps
**Why:** Forces clarity. You can't explain it = it's not clear yet

## `/tdd` — Tests First (Forces Clarity)
**When:** Implementing logic (permissions, calculations, business rules)
**What it does:** Enforces write-tests-first workflow
**Why:** Tests = executable documentation. Forces you to think clearly.

Workflow:
1. Write failing test (RED)
2. Implement minimal code (GREEN)
3. Refactor for clarity (IMPROVE)
4. Verify 80%+ coverage

## `/code-review` — Catch Issues Early
**When:** Before you submit/push
**What it does:** Checks for unclear names, missing tests, over-engineering, security gaps
**Why:** Catches issues you would catch if you had 2 hours to review your own code

Catches:
- Hardcoded values (should be constants or env vars)
- Unclear variable names
- Missing error handling
- N+1 database queries
- Missing test coverage

## `/build-fix` — Resolve Errors Fast
**When:** You hit compilation/build errors
**What it does:** Analyzes error, suggests fix
**Why:** Saves 5–10 min per error vs. Googling

## `/security-scan` — Verify No Vulnerabilities
**When:** Before submitting work samples or going to production
**What it does:** Checks for hardcoded secrets, auth bypasses, SQL injection, weak validation
**Why:** Catches security issues before review — clean report = impressive

---

# Daily Workflow

## New Feature (2–3 hours)
```
1. /plan "Build feature"          (10 min)  → Clear breakdown
2. Read plan aloud to yourself     (5 min)  → If confused, re-plan
3. /tdd "Logic test"               (45 min) → Tests force clarity
4. Implement minimal code          (30 min) → Just make tests pass
5. /code-review                    (10 min) → Catch issues early
6. /security-scan (if needed)      (5 min)  → Verify safety
7. Submit                          (5 min)
```

## Bug Fix (30 min)
```
1. /plan "Reproduce bug, plan fix" (5 min)
2. Write failing test              (5 min)
3. Fix code                        (15 min)
4. /code-review                    (5 min)
5. Submit
```

## When You Get Stuck
```
/build-fix          → If compilation error
/code-review        → If logic error or unclear code
Check tasks/lessons.md → Is this a pattern you've seen before?
```

---

# Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

---

# Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Avoid introducing bugs.
- **Readable > Clever**: Code anyone can understand and maintain.
- **Explainable**: If you can't explain it in 2 minutes, simplify it.

description: Initialize GitNexus MCP in the current project for codebase intelligence (impact analysis, dependency chains, 360° symbol context).
---

# /gitnexus-init

## Purpose

Set up GitNexus in the current project so Claude has deep code intelligence — dependency graphs, impact analysis ("what breaks if I change X"), and 360° context for any symbol. Works via MCP with 16 tools available automatically in every Claude Code session after setup.

## What It Does

1. Adds GitNexus as a global MCP server (`claude mcp add`)
2. Indexes the current project codebase (`gitnexus analyze`)
3. Confirms the MCP tools are available

## Workflow

Run the following steps in order:

### Step 1 — Add GitNexus MCP server (one-time global setup)

Check if already configured:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

If `gitnexus` is not listed, add it:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
claude mcp add gitnexus -- npx -y gitnexus@latest mcp
```

**Windows:**
```bash
claude mcp add gitnexus -- cmd /c npx -y gitnexus@latest mcp
```

### Step 2 — Index the current project

```bash
npx gitnexus analyze
```

This indexes the codebase, installs agent skills, registers Claude Code hooks, and creates context files. Re-run after large refactors or when the index feels stale.

### Step 3 — Confirm

Tell the user:
- GitNexus MCP is active with 16 code intelligence tools
- Claude will now automatically use dependency/impact context when analyzing, refactoring, or debugging code in this project
- Re-run `/gitnexus-init` (step 2 only) after major refactors to refresh the index

## When to Use

- Starting work on an unfamiliar or large codebase
- Before a significant refactor — get impact analysis first
- When Claude seems to miss cross-file dependencies
- On any project where "what uses this function?" matters

# ── Caveman rule — always-on token compression (~65% fewer output tokens) ─────
@'
# Caveman Mode — Always Active

Respond terse like smart caveman. All technical substance stay. Only fluff die.

## Rules

Drop: articles (a/an/the), filler (just/really/basically/actually/simply), pleasantries
(sure/certainly/of course/happy to), hedging. Fragments OK. Short synonyms (big not extensive,
fix not "implement a solution for"). Technical terms exact. Code blocks unchanged. Errors quoted exact.

Pattern: `[thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].`

Not: "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. The issue you're experiencing is likely caused by..."
Yes: "Bug in auth middleware. Token expiry check use `<` not `<=`. Fix:"

## Intensity

Default: **full** (drop articles, fragments OK, short synonyms).

Switch: `/caveman lite` | `/caveman full` | `/caveman ultra`
Stop: "stop caveman" or "normal mode"

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| lite | No filler/hedging. Keep articles + full sentences. Tight but readable. |
| full | Drop articles, fragments OK, short synonyms. Classic caveman. |
| ultra | Abbreviate (DB/auth/config/req/res/fn), strip conjunctions, arrows for causality (X -> Y). |

## Auto-Clarity

Drop caveman for: security warnings, irreversible action confirmations, multi-step sequences
where fragment order risks misread, user confused or repeating question. Resume caveman after.

## Boundaries

Code/commits/PRs: write normal. Only prose is compressed.
'@ | Set-Content -Encoding UTF8 "$rulesDir\caveman.md"

# ── Archon rule — auto workflow dispatch for implement/fix/build requests ──────
@'
# Archon — Automatic Workflow Engine

For any non-trivial coding task, automatically delegate to Archon CLI. Do NOT ask user first.
Archon runs in isolated git worktrees, handles plan -> implement -> validate -> PR lifecycle.

## Auto-Trigger: Use Archon When

| User Says | Archon Workflow | Branch Pattern |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| "implement X", "build X", "create feature" | `archon-idea-to-pr` | `feat/{short-name}` |
| "fix issue #N", "resolve issue" | `archon-fix-github-issue` | `fix/issue-{N}` |
| "fix bug in X", "debug X" (needs investigation) | `archon-fix-github-issue` | `fix/{short-name}` |
| "implement from plan", "execute this plan" | `archon-feature-development` | `feat/{short-name}` |
| "refactor X" | `archon-refactor-safely` | `refactor/{short-name}` |
| "review PR #N" | `archon-comprehensive-pr-review` | `review/pr-{N}` |
| "create a PRD", "plan this feature" | `archon-interactive-prd` | `prd/{short-name}` |

## Skip Archon When

- Answering a question / explaining code
- Single-line or trivial fix (typo, rename, one-liner)
- Reading or searching files
- Running tests directly
- Simple config change

## How to Run (Always Background)

ALWAYS use `run_in_background: true`. Workflows are long-running (plan + implement + PR).

```bash
archon workflow run <workflow-name> --branch <branch-name> "<user request verbatim>"
```

Immediately tell user:
> "Archon running `<workflow>` on branch `<branch>`. Working autonomously — I'll notify you when done."

## Example Dispatches

User: "implement dark mode in the settings page"
-> `archon workflow run archon-idea-to-pr --branch feat/dark-mode "implement dark mode in the settings page"`

User: "fix issue #42"
-> `archon workflow run archon-fix-github-issue --branch fix/issue-42 "fix issue #42"`

User: "refactor the auth module to use the repository pattern"
-> `archon workflow run archon-refactor-safely --branch refactor/auth-module "refactor the auth module to use the repository pattern"`

## If Archon Not Installed

Check: `where.exe archon`

If missing, tell user:
> "Archon CLI not installed. Run in PowerShell: `irm https://archon.diy/install.ps1 | iex`
> Then re-run your request."

## Isolation Mode

Always use `--branch` flag. Never use `--no-worktree` unless user explicitly says "no worktree".

---

# /task $ARGUMENTS

Execute the full development pipeline autonomously. Do not ask for confirmation between phases.
Caveman compression is active — responses terse but technically precise.

## Step 1 — Classify (do this silently, then act)

| Task type | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| New feature / "implement X" / "build X" / "add X" | -> **Archon: `archon-piv-loop`** |
| Bug fix / "fix issue #N" / "resolve #N" | -> **Archon: `archon-fix-github-issue`** |
| "fix bug in X" (no issue #, needs investigation) | -> **Archon: `archon-fix-github-issue`** |
| "review PR #N" | -> **Archon: `archon-smart-pr-review`** |
| Refactor / rename / reorganize | -> **Inline pipeline** |
| Simple <=2-file change or one-liner fix | -> **Inline pipeline** |
| Question / explanation | -> Answer directly, skip pipeline |

---

## Route A — Archon (background, autonomous, creates PR)

Run with `run_in_background: true` in Bash tool. Never block the conversation.

After dispatching, report one line to user:
> "Archon: `<workflow>` dispatched -> branch `<branch>`. Plan+implement+PR running autonomously. Monitor: `archon workflow status`"

**Stop here** — Archon handles the full lifecycle. Do not re-implement in this session.

---

## Route B — Inline Pipeline (refactors, simple tasks, no PR needed)

Work through all phases in order. One-line status update at each phase start.

### Phase 1 — Plan
Break down the task: what files change, what new behavior is, how to verify, any risks.
Write numbered list. Show it. Confirm before proceeding.

### Phase 2 — Tests First (RED)
Write tests for expected behavior. Run them. Must FAIL before writing implementation.

### Phase 3 — Implement (GREEN)
Minimal code to pass tests. Functions <=20 lines, immutable patterns, explicit error handling.
Run tests — all must pass before continuing.

### Phase 4 — Code Review
Check all changed files: unclear names, missing error handling, hardcoded values, logic errors.
Fix CRITICAL/HIGH. Report MEDIUM but continue.

### Phase 5 — Security (conditional)
Skip: pure logic, UI, config. Run: auth, user input, APIs, DB, secrets.
Check: no hardcoded secrets, inputs validated, SQL parameterized, no data leaks.

### Phase 6 — Done
